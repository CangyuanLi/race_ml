  abstract    = {We study links between the labor market for loan officers and access to mortgage credit. Using novel data matching the (near) universe of mortgage applications to loan officers, we find that minorities are significantly underrepresented among loan officers. Minority borrowers are less likely to complete mortgage applications, have completed applications approved, and to ultimately take-up a loan. These disparities are significantly reduced when minority borrowers work with minority loan officers. Minority borrowers working with minority loan officers also have lower default rates. Our results suggest that minority underrepresentation among loan officers has adverse effects on minority borrowers’ access to credit.},

The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), a recurrent neural network architecture commonly used for natural language processing, was chosen as the model for our study. The Florida Voter Registration was used as the training and testing data. Special care was given for the accuracy of minority groups by adjusting the imbalance in the dataset. The models were trained and exported to C++ and then integrated with R using Rcpp. Additionally, the availability, accuracy, and performance of the package were compared with other solutions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and a modified, full gradient version of the LSTM learning algorithm. We evaluate Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) and several other network architectures on the benchmark task of framewise phoneme classification, using the TIMIT database. Our main findings are that bidirectional networks outperform unidirectional ones, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is much faster and also more accurate than both standard Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) and time-windowed Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results support the view that contextual information is crucial to speech processing, and suggest that BLSTM is an effective architecture with which to exploit it.11An abbreviated version of some portions of this article appeared in (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005), as part of the IJCNN 2005 conference proceedings, published under the IEEE copyright.},
